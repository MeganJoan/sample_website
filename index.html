    <h1>The Jaeger Jagon Story</h1>

    <p>
      It is a little known fact that Jaeger is <em>actually a dragon</em>, rather than a cat. Her cat performance is very convincing, but a keen eye can spot the give aways. For example, she frequently snorts like a jagon and uses her tail to knocks things off surfaces or attack those around her. She also keeps treasures which she moves around the house to various hiding places. Who else is known to keep treasures? <strong>A dragon.</strong> <a href="https://meganjoan.github.io/sample_website/treasure">Sign up to recieve your jagon treasures</a> nao.

    <h2>Dragons</h2>

    <p>
      Dragons were previously thought to be mythical creatures, and have existed in folklore for centuries. Athough they were previously thought to be <em><strong>magical</em></strong> creatures our experiences with Jaeger has lead us to believe that they are just moody and exentric rather than magical.
